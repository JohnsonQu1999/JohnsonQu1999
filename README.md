### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Johnson Qu. I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at McMaster University.

One of my main extracurricular interests is McMaster Baja Racing - a student run engineering team that designs, builds, tests and races a single seat offroad vehicle each year. I am also interested in Control systems and Embedded systems. I consider myself lucky because I've managed to marry my interests into a single co-op experience that combines them all - I am currently working as a Vehicle Dynamics Control System co-op at General Motors Canada.

When it comes to programming, I dabble in C, Python, Arduino and Java. I am currently learning HTML and CSS so I can build my own website. I use MATLAB on a daily basis.

I enjoy getting involved in the engineering student community. I am an engineering mentor, an engineering welcome week representative, a DeltaHacks logistics executive, Mechatronics Society merchandise coordinator and an MES social committee member.
